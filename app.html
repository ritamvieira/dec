			<h1 class=gametitle>Tetris App<h1>
			<p class=gameinfo>The Tetris App is a dreadful way of implementing a great game onto mobiles. There are two modes of control, but neither are good. In one mode, you rotate by tapping, and swipe down and to the side to position the block. The problem here is that the controls seem way too jumpy, and you will often find yourself hard dropping a block without having meant to. The other mode of control sees ghosts of your block appear at the bottom of the screen, and you just tap where you want the block to go. But this takes all of the skill and tension out of the game. A frankly terrible game, with little to no multilayer options.</p>
