		<div class=History><p>The history of Tetris is shockingly complicated. It all began in Russia in 1984. Alexey Pajitnov created the game, not intending to make a fortune, but instead
		expecting to just make a fun game. Pajitnov called the game Tetris because it combined the prefix "tetra" (Means 4) and tennis, which was Pajitnov's favorite
		game. Pajitnov shared the game with his coworkers, who played it and shared it over and over again. Eventually, the game reached Robert Stein, who owned  Andromeda Software Ltd.. Stein loved the game, and helped to license out the game so that it could finally be sold. The game faced numerous legal and commercial issues before it finally reached Nintendo. Eventually, it was decided that every Game Boy system would come with a copy of Tetris. From there, the game absolutely exploded, and became the best selling game of all time, only recently being outsold by Minecraft. The game has seen numerous editions and spin offs, but the core mechanics remain the same: position your blocks so that they connect with other blocks, and clear lines. A feature that was not included in the original game but is now considered a main stay of the franchise is the hold mechanic, which allows you to save a block for later use. The game, debatably, peaked with the release of Tetris 99, in which you play against 98 other players, sending lines at them with the hope that they will touch the top of the screen, and you will come out victorious. Nevertheless, Tetris is a cultural icon that provides fun for millions everyday.</p></div>
