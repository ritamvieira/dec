				<h1 class=gametitle>Tetris Twist<h1>
				<p class=gameinfo>Tetris Twist is a good game that doesn't strive to reinvent the wheel, but instead takes the core mechanics of Tetris and does something interesting with them. Twist features a story mode, and no, the story isn't that good, but the actual levels are. Each level presents a new way to win, that always keep the game fresh and never let the game stagnate. It's not the best Tetris ever made, but it's certainly a decent competitor.</p>
