			<h1 class=gametitle>Classic Tetris<h1>
			<p class=gameinfo>Classic Tetris is pretty great, but it definitely has some issues that hold it back. For one, you can't hold blocks. This means that you often get into tricky situations, and you have to work around an awkward placement. Also, the lack of color is certainly an issue. An important part of Tetris is recognizing what block you have, and without color, it takes a few extra seconds to realize what is dropping. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but towards the end of a game, it becomes an issue. That being said, Tetris on the Game Boy started a revolution, and that needs to be recognized and praised.</p>
