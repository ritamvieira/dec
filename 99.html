			<h1 class=gametitle>Tetris 99<h1>
			<p class=gameinfo>This game is near perfection. There are a few things missing, but Tetris 99 looks like it's going to fill the gap that the shutting down of Tetris Friends left. Tetris 99 is a battle royale Tetris, so immediately it's unique. On top of that, the game has other gamemodes, including marathon and single player, which are both excellent. The best part is, this game is free, as long as you pay for the Nintendo Switch Online Service, which you need to play the game anyway. You do need to pay a small fee for the single player modes, but honestly, it is most definitely worth it. An absolutely fantastic version of a fantastic game.</p>
