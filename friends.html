			<h1 class=gametitle>Tetris Friends<h1>
			<p class=gameinfo>One of the greatest games of all time. Tetris Friends was a browser game in which you could play Tetris in a large variety of ways. There were tons of both multiplayer and single player modes, each with its own spin on the classic game. The most popular mode was Battle 2p, in which you were randomly paired up with opponents of your skill level. You would have to battle it out until the time runs out, or one of the players gets 3 KOs. If the time ran out, the person with the most lines sent to the other player would win, and get to gain a star. Get five stars, and you would rank up. This game was the perfect Tetris; the controls were tight, and the sensitivity was perfect. There will most likely never be a game as perfect as this one. Sadly, on May 31st, 2019, Tetris Friends was shut down.</p>
