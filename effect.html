			<h1 class=gametitle>Tetris Effect<h1>
			<p class=gameinfo>Rather than truly innovating the game itself, Tetris Effect innovates the presentation of the game. The only thing keeping this game out of S tier is the fact that the game is your run of the mill Tetris. This should tell you how gorgeous the presentation is. Everything about this game screams flair. The visuals are an insane blend of LED and strobe lights that bounce to the music. The music is amazing too, with tracks that were clearly thought about before they were implemented into the game. If only this game wasn't a Playstation exclusive. *sigh*</p>
