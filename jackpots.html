			<h1 class=gametitle>Tetris Jackpots<h1>
			<p class=gameinfo>Oh, Tetris Jackpots. If there's one thing I hate more than casinos, it's slot machines, and that is exactly what Tetris Jackpots is. This is barely a Tetris game, but I included it because it is licensed by the actual Tetris company. The game is your run of the mill slot machine, just with a Tetris themed coat of paint. It frustrates me that Tetris would make a machine that in my eyes promotes a dangerous lifestyle, but hey, what are you gonna do?</p>
