			<h1 class=gametitle>Tetris Ultimate<h1>
			<p class=gameinfo>Tetris Ultimate really isn't that ultimate. The only feature that sets this game apart from others is the battle mechanic, which was done much better in games like Tetris Friends. Tetris Ultimate is build on battling with friends, but there are much better, much more FREE games that offer this same package in a much better experience. By no means is this game bad, but it is simply unoriginal and uninteresting.</p>
