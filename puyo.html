			<h1 class=gametitle>Puyo Puyo Tetris<h1>
			<p class=gameinfo>This is a weird, weird game. This game blends the Puyo Puyo series with Tetris, and although these two wouldn't seem like they mesh very well...well, they kind of do. The game is not bad, but it is so different from classic Tetris that it might put players off a bit. As well, the anime-esque story is not very well thought out, and often feels more awkward than something that absolutely had to be in the game. This is a great game for wasting time with, but there isn't very much to sink your teeth into unfortunately.</p>
