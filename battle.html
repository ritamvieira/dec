			<h1 class=gametitle>Tetris Battle Drop<h1>
			<p class=gameinfo>Tetris Battle Drop comes off looking like a bad rip-off of Tetris Friends. The only difference between the two is that Tetris Battle Drop is available on mobile devices (Although not phones, oddly enough), and that Tetris Battle Drop has fewer modes to play around with. While it was still available, Tetris Friends was supreme to Tetris Battle Drop in every way imaginable. Despite this, Tetris Battle Drop still offers a different experience from some of the games in lower tiers.</p>
