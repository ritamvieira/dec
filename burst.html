			<h1 class=gametitle>Tetris Burst<h1>
			<p class=gameinfo>Tetris Burst is a weird game. Now, it is pretty much your standard Tetris, but the unique thing about this game is the animation and the power ups. Burst features animation that makes it seem like you are in the jungle, which is certainly cool, but it isn't what makes the graphics unique. When you complete a line, the blocks all burst like they are made of juice. Although cool when you first see it, it can get annoying, and at times distracting. Also, the power ups are an unneeded addition that just cater towards a more casual demographic. A very un-special Tetris, but a unique one at that.</p>
